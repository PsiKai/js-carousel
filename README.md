# Plain Javascript Carousel

This is a basic framework for an infinitely looping carousel of images.

Basic styles are set in CSS but the core of the functionality comes from inside the script tags in the html.

The carousel is set up to take 5 images. As the images slides out of view, it becomes inivisible via opacity and slides across to the other side of the viewport to get in line for the next loop through of images, resulting in a smooth transition from last image to first image

Very basic tech. Comes with 5 images to demonstrate, and are all static files.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS (es6)

### TODO:

- Optimize the carousel function to work for any number of images.
